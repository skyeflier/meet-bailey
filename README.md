# Meet Bailey
## Description
This project aims to create a single-page application portfolio for web developers using React. The main motivation behind this project is to provide employers with a way to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples. The portfolio allows employers to assess whether a candidate is a good fit for an open position.

The portfolio consists of a header, a section for content, and a footer. The header contains the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio. The navigation titles include About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted. When a navigation title is clicked, the corresponding section is presented below the navigation without the page reloading, and that title is highlighted.

The About Me section includes a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them. The Portfolio section includes titled images of six of the developer's applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository. The Contact section includes a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message. The Resume section includes a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer's proficiencies.
